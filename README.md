# Oscillatory Dark Field (ODF)

This repository hosts a speculative research manuscript exploring a unified dark sector framework based on an **Oscillatory Dark Field (ODF)**.

The manuscript examines whether gravitational phenomena commonly attributed to separate dark matter and dark energy components could arise from scale- and coherence-dependent behavior of a single non-baryonic oscillatory field.

## Status
- Speculative / conceptual
- Assumption-driven
- Falsifiable in principle
- No claim of observational discovery
